# Hazur
**Introduction**
*What is happiness?
How can I stay happy?
what is love?
How can i free of all sufferings?*

Life is full of these type of questions at every stage of life we face a new question but very few of us get answers and rest of us like me spend our whole life in finding answers and at the end we still not get the proper answer. We starts with a questions and end with a new question at various steps we conqur a dillema What is right? and what is so called right?, What to do and What not to do. What give us relief? and what gives us pain? Difference between love and attachment?

Religion and Religious books are best source of answers to all of these questions. Shri Guru Granth sahib ji(SGGS) is one of such unviersal source to answer these questions. It does not speak about any religion however it speaks about every religion.
Sri Guru Granth Sahib contains 5894 hymns. Guru Arjan contributed the largest number of 2216 hymns. Besides the hymns of other Gurus, he also included 937 hymns of fifteen other saints and eleven poet laureates of the Guruâ€™s court whose compositions tallied with the gospel of the Sikh faith. Here, the Hindu, the Muslim, the Brahmin, and the untouchable, all meet in the same congregation of holy souls to create a truly universal scripture for our world.

From the linguistic point of view, Sri Guru Granth Sahib is a treasury of the languages of its times that communicated well with every segment of the society. The language principally employed is the language of the saints, evolved during the medieval period. Based upon the local dialects, it was leavened with expressions from Sanskrit, Prakrit, Persian, Arabic, Bengali and Marathi etc. This language allowed for variations and still enjoyed wide currency in Southeast Asia. Its appeal is found in its directness, energy and resilience.

Hazur provide you interface where you ask questions and Hazur gives you answer using SGGS so we can safely ask Hazur anything and none of our sentiments get hurt. You Gives your question in simple Phrases or in simple words. It provide you answer in both Gurmukhi and English Translation and Transliration Then you can share that question to social media's so that everyone knows Not only that you can read gurbani. It's meaning and then tag it.

For example reading "nanak dukhiya sabh sansaar, so sukhiya jin naam adhaar"
which means O nanak, whole world is suffering, the one who relies on naam (meditation) is the only one that does not suffer.
now after reading this, a person may say it answers the question about "how can I stop suffering ?
whereas other may get an answer to "am i suffering alone ?"
or I may get an answer to "Why should i chant name, and meditate ?"
now this one verse answers three questions
and there will be more with more people around
so this aapp also allows verses to be tagged as questions.
